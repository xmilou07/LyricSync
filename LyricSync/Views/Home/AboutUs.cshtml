        <p>
            Hi! My name is Xavina and I’m a second-year MBO 4 Software Developer student.
        </p>

        <p>
            This project was created as part of my <em>Frameworks Gevorderd</em>. After an orientation on two frameworks,
            I chose to further evolve my knowledge on ASP .NET Core.
        </p>

        <p>
            The goal of this project is to apply professional development practices — such as separating responsibilities
            in code, writing automated tests, and implementing authentication, authorization, and data validation —
            while creating something creative and useful.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m passionate about learning how real-world software is built and continuously improving my skills as a developer.
            This project reflects both my technical growth and my interest in combining creativity (like working with music and
            lyrics) with solid software engineering principles.
        </p>
