Sweet is the sun
Warm is the rain
June is the month
Free is the day
My hand's still shakin', my mind's still racin'
My heart's still breakin' in two
I'm still changin', my friends stay patient
My mother still calls for the news
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that enough?
Gone are the birds
Close are the tears
A house full of love
Space for your fears
My hand's still shakin', my mind's still racin'
My heart's still breakin' in two
I'm still changin', my friends stay patient
My mother still calls for the news
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that enough?
